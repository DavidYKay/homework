Assoc Entity types for m-way relationships
    Example:
        Part 
        Supplier
        Project
            These all depended on the Uses
                Therefore, use solid lines
        Uses
            Associative entity type

    Example 2:
        Enrollment Registers Student
        Enrollment Grants Offering
        Attendance RecordedFor Enrollment

Generalization Hierarchies

    HourlyEmp

Inheritance
    Direct/indirect
    inherit attributes from parent

Constraints
    Disjointness Constraint
    Completeness Constraint

Business Rules
    Formal representation in ERD
    Informal representation in documentation associated with an ERD

Formal Representation
    Primary key constraints -- main way of identifying business entities
    Named relationships -- direct connetions between entitites
    Identification dependency: knowledge of other entities for identification
    Cardinalities: restrict num of related entities in a business situation
        M-N?
    Generalization hierarchies: classification of entities and organizational policies

Informal Representation
    Candidate key constraints
    Reasonable values  - fixed collection of values or consistent with another attribute
    Null value constraints: enforces completeness
    Default values -- help to shorted data entry

Diagram rules
    Similar syntax rules to prog langages
    Completeness rules
    Consistency: no conflicts
Completeness rules
    PK Rule: all entities have a PK (direct, indirect, inherited)
    Naming rule: Name entities consistently
    Cardinality rule: cardinality specified in both directions
    Entity participation rule: All entities participate in at least one relationship
    ---

Primary Key Rule
    For some weak entities, the PK rule is subtle:
        weak entity with 1-M 
        Weak entity must have local key to augment borrowed PK from parent entity type
        in Violation of PK rule if local key is missing

Naming consistency rules
    Inherited attribute rule: att names don't match inherited names

relationship names
    no uniqueness requirement
    Participating entities provide context for relationship names

Connection consistency rules
    Relationship/Entity Connection Rule
        Relationships conect TWO entity types (can be the same one)
    Relationship/relationship Connection 

Identification Dependency Rules
    Weak entity rule
    Indentifying relationship rule
    Identification

Redundant Foreign Key Rule

Chen ERD Notation
    Course::CourseNo O:N -- Has -- 1:1 Offering::OfferNo

UML
    Standard notation for object-oriented modeling
    Class diagrams, interface diagrams, and interaction diagrams
    more complex than ERD notation
    Can show (weak) association class with a dotted line, T-junction to strong relationship

Generalization Relationship
    Undergrad Graduate both point to Student 
        Student is a generalization relationship

Composition Relationship
    Order has-a OrderLine

Summary
    Data modeling is an important skill
    Crow's foot ERD notation is widely used
    Use notation precisely
    Use diagram rules to ensure structural consistency and completeness
    Understanding ERD notation is a prereq to applying the notation on business problems
