Collision Code
Speed of the car - gearing
Didn't apply the experience code - wacky turning code
Need to add timeout code -- we haven't
    Like a heartbeat 5 pulses


Has been added:
    Penalize going off-track
    Server view has been added

TODO:
    Stress test on bostain's machine
    
Overall - nice job

HOMEWORK
    due Sunday night

    Background:
        Big signs over the road: "Moose in the highway" "Snow ahead" "Congestion"
            Usually made out of individual LCDS
            old ones were mechanical
    80 x 10 LEDs
    Take a script:
        Code COLON String of Text
            Example:
                0:COS210
                1:Hello World
                2:Mr. Fish goes to town
                3:Tommy Tuttle
    Display that string on a display board
    We're going to have transitions
    Transition into the message
        Top down, left to right, one letter at a time, column at a time, bounce animation, etc.
   
    Bostain's code:
        Read file
        Get the LEDs up
        Two utility methods
            Turn all on
            Turn all off
        
                

    Our code:
        Transitions


TOUR
    new Thread((Runnable) jc).start();
    LEDDisplay
        creates a new LEDDisplayQueue
        loadsQueue from script
        this.view = new LEDDIsplayView(queue)
    
    queue.enqueue(
    new LEDDisplayItem(
        value1, 
        getTransition(value2)
    ))

LEDDisplayQueue
    LinkedList to implement a queue
        offer()
        poll()

Our transitions extend LEDDisplayTransition
    -hasA factory method
    go(view, leds)
        -called to show the leds

LEDDisplayView
    has LEDDisplayQueue, 10x80 array of LEDs
    clearLEDS, setLEDS - both for turning all on

final in method context means no override

***
    0:Flash a couple times, then solid. Words centered.
    1:Message comes in from the top, remain in the middle for some time, out the bottom
    2:Scroll in from right, out the left
    3:"Surprise me" - "Make me smile" - "Artsy"
    4,5,6 - optional
