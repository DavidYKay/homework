Yellow highlight as mouse over
Red highlight when clicked

Assemble the picutre as quick as possible

Coding: think about it and what's going on

JFrame - fixed size

Slice the photo into little squares

intercept mouse clicks
figure out which square we're in
capture mousedown/mouseup

Could be a gridlayout
could be painting directly on a JPAnel

What if the image isn't exactly divisble?
    Center the image, make it as big as we can, minus some margin

Mission one:
    Code in place to get a JFrame up

    eventqueue
        invokelater
            runnable

Mission two:
Get Jpanel we can draw on
    mjp - passing num boxes x, num boxes y

loadImage
    Doesn't make any sense to continue without the image

Set images by truncating anything less than SIDE
