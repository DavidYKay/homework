    1 extra column
        called portion
        display: (int) portionDefault + portionDisplayName
    Calories have been fixed to real calories
        actual calories = calories * portionDefault / portionAmount
    Window a bit bigger
    Columns three different sizes
        -So that they're nice
    Search now searches the food column, only
    Calories are editable 
        -Just for this session, not permanently
        -Keep in mind it's still a double value, not an int
