Extend JApplet instead of JFrame
    JApplet serves a direct drop-in to JFrame

No main method - because they're loaded into special instance of JVM
    Instead
        Constructor
        init()
            called after constructor
            initialization, load resources, ***get string params from applet tag
        start()
            called every time the page gets active/navigated to
            Start threads/animation here
        stop()
            Navigate away from page
            Stop threads/animation here
        destroy()
            exit browser
            Applet removed from the JVM here
            Usually don't have to override this
            ***close server files nicely here

        
attributes
    codebase
        foreign url, anywhere on the internet
    code = ".class"
        exists in same directory as html
    width
    height
    archive="jarname.jar"
        jar contains .class
        reduces loadtime by sending one file
    vspace
    hspace
        spacing/padding around the applet
    align
        left, right, top, texttop, middle, absmiddle, baseline, bottom, absbottom
        
    alt
        Like img alt text
<applet
    attributes
    >
    <param />
    <param />
</applet>

param tag
    Just like String[] args
    can pass data from webpage into applet

JFrames can contain JApplets, Applets can't contain frames
    main calls init() then start()
    Create a jframe, jframe.add(applet)

Applet security
    Applets not allowed to read/write from file system
    Applets not allowed to invoke local programs
    Applet not allowed t oconnect to other systems
    *Trusted Applets can bypass security
        but it's a PITA
        Can self-sign
        Can go to an authority, too
        *Linked in slides

Pathing
    //On the websever
    //this.getClass() - highly introspective call
    //Dynamic reflection
    //Consider "Java Reflection in action" book
    URL iconURL = this.getClass().getResource("images/icon.jpg")
    ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon(iconURL);

Audio
    contained in Applet class
    start stop loop 
        only methods
    use AudioClip class
    wav, aiff, midi, au, rmf
